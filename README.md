# Markdown to Webpage Converter 

This project is based on the revolutionary[*] idea of maintaining a blog/webpage using markdown. To use: 

- `in/` is where all the input markdown assets live.
	- `in/blog` is the blog folder and should be flat 
	- `in/other1/other2` up to a depth of **4** are static assets 
	 
- `out/` is where your blog lives 

one day they will be search for now we are keeping it simple.
