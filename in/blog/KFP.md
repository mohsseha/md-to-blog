# Giving Technical Interviews

A few interview patterns for tech: 

- **Should take ~10% of your time:** you probably are leaving talent on the table if you are not constantly looking 

- **Know thy candidate:** don’t ask a python variable question to a person who’s been programing for 30 years and don’t expect a college jr. to know how memory cache misses work. 

- **Be uniform in interviewing:** have at least 30% of your questions the same across candidates to make sure you are comparing apple-to-apples

- **Always Sell the position:** the best need to feel they are joining an enthusiastic team. Make sure to explicitly state your best features.
