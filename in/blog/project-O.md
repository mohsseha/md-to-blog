# Managing Managers

I came across this article recently:
https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/the-evolution-of-project-oxygen/

It has a few nice nuggets that tech managers find useful:
 
- Good managers *cause* better performance. 
- It summarises key values a tech manager should espouse(or at least seriously consider):

- regular survays of your employees like [this](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-give-feedback-to-managers/steps/try-googles-manager-feedback-survey/) are probably a good idea.

Personally, I never want to manage without the last one.
