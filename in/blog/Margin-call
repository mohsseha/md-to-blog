# Margin Call

This is one of my favorite buisness movies ever. It captured the dynamics of organizations attempting to make quick
and critical decisions accurately.

The trailer makes it looks like a Wolf Of Wall Street knock offs but I think it's much more subtle (and useful in our everyday life than that). 
I'd recommend watching they key decision scene where Jeremy Irons walks in a room. It was spectacular! And reminded me of one my favorite books about charisma:

I highly recommend both!
