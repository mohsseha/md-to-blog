# Practitioner Focused ML Course

Recently this course came online: 
https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/

With a wonderful library of videos:

It seems to be a great focus on a practical ML/DL perspective and scale. 

I usually love to recommend [MLSS](http://mlss.cc) and [Deep Dive Book](https://d2l.ai/) for people who want to get a solid technical overview of ML/DL/AI topics, this course seems to be more focused on practical considerations at scale.
