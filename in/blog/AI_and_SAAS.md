# AI & Traditional SAAS Businesses 

I was talking to a freind ([@dillonrgardner](https://twitter.com/dillonrgardner)) about this paper [a16z](https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/) about how software margins and how AI plays will be part of the eco system. '

A few thoughts: 
I buy the basic premise: AI/ML business don't scale as well as SAAS as a general rule. Things that reduce margins and scale:  

- Often, new customers bring in new corner cases which requires new training data and expensive training pipelines. 
- Training Data is a messy ball of wax because you need to a) generate it b) build infrastructure to manager it c) label it in many cases 
- For a lot of applications (eg. vision, more advanced NLP) there are realistically a small number of players that will give you SOTA performance. Meaning the FAANGS of the world have a natural advantage over smaller players. Take for example any recent CNN architecture is probably at least $1 million in cloud cost just to design the model (see section 5 of  [a recent example](https:	//arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05027.pdf) and [this](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/05/using-machine-learning-to-explore.html) for more context). 
- **NB** Privacy laws and requirements can *substantially* affect the above costs and margins.

One thing that I think is less important than what the article describes is the issue of inference and Moore's law effects: even in vision applications there are not that many DL models that are bottlenecked by processing power alone. The only exception to this is  in a safety critical space like driving where you need every. ounce. of. accuracy. 


### AI and software are not *that different* in one key aspect:

This is a key consideration when thinking about scaling an AI business: what applies for regular software applies ML: **complexity kills** and you are well-advised to reformulate your problem domain to severely limit possibilities of corner cases as much as possible. 


#### PS: don't you just *hate* it when someone says AI when the mostly mean DL ? ðŸ˜Š
