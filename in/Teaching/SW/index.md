# Things that will help you become a software engineer

- This is not the same as getting a job. For the latter look at [interview prep](/Teaching/Interviews)
- [Blog](/blog/software_engineering) has a few articles that I hope are interesting 

I think Software Engineering is a slight mis-nomer at least from the perspective as someone who was trained and practiced being a "vanilla" mechanical engineer

| software engineers| vanilla Engineers|
|-------------------|------------------|
| - intimate human-to-human interaction| - intermediate human-to-human interaction|
| - deployment cost function flat | - deployment cost function dominating |
| - personalities and engineer-to-engineer selling completely dominates the culture| 


I feel I can write a book about this topic, maybe one day I will |buissness constraints dominate|
 
This is where I keep resouces for myself and my students. Broadly you will find: code, slides and links to online resouces. 

Focus is on: 
- BAAI Meetup and Recent AI/ML Papers 
    - index.md: 
- Machine Learning and Data Science:
    - index.md: Reference to GA class 
    - ML-YouTube.md
- Software Engineering 
    - index.md: SE-YouTube.md 
    - Conferences and Workshops Presentations-n-code
- Tech Job Interviewing 
- Academic work
    - index.md: inline a few slides and thesis 

# Teaching And Training
