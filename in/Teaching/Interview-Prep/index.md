# Job Interview Prep for **Both** Sides of The Table:

A collection of resources and opinions to help you navigate the tech job interview process regardless if you are looking for a job or a new team-member. 


### General

* **Ethics**: is something that should be focused on more. You don't want to hire someone without a strong ethical backbone and you don't want to work with co-workers that don't prioritize ethics. Trust me you on this. [This](https://hiring.monster.com/employer-resources/recruiting-strategies/interviewing-candidates/interview-questions-to-ask-candidates/) is as good a place to start as any.

* **Prepping** there is no way around it even if it's stupid. [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) is a great resource.

* **Collaboration**:
	- "give example of projects that teams collaborated on? " 

### Programming & Software Engineering:

Interview methods and prep is a decisive topic. On the one hand you want to make sure whoever you hire [knows how to program](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/) at the same time, it can be argued that the [standard white-boarding exterzise](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) is just hazing. You are not going to resolve this so you might as well prep:

* Intermediate videos here

* The standard book: http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/ is a great resource if you stop fighting it.
* pretty good repo: https://github.com/labuladong/fucking-algorithm/tree/english

* an intresting reddit thread [python focused](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1knw7z/python_interview_questions/)

I love this quote:

>	 you don't need to know algorithms with somone's name on it for an interview but there are few exceptions, 1. Dijkstra's 2. Kadane's 3. Bellman ford - negative edges


Ok, so this is a little bit crazy:

I'd not take it too seriously **but** it does have a ton of good resouces. 

* there are a lot of sites that help with Coding prep [leetcode](https://leetcode.com) seems to have a great reputation.
