# More Advaced ML Topics: 

I've always been a big fan of the MLSS [(Machine Learning Summer School)](http://www.mlss.cc/) though they can be a bit too specialized. There are plenty of topic byond Deep Learning. Videos and slides available:

- [video lectures](http://videolectures.net/site/search/?q=MLSS)
- [2020 videos](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2020/schedule.html)
- I find myself flipping back and forth between this and [the Deep Dive Book](https://d2l.ai/)
