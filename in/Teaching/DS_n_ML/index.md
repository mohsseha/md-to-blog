## DL Engineering Course: 
[Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) is a great practical course: 

- Good focus on ML infrastructure issues. 
- Has quite a few heavy hitters as contributors. 
- Lots of practical pointers. Roughly lives [here](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/course-gitbook/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png) compared to other sites


## Fast.AI course: 
https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527

A Very pragmatic book:

# More Advaced ML Topics: 

I've always been a big fan of the MLSS [(Machine Learning Summer School)](http://www.mlss.cc/) though they can be a bit too specialized. There are plenty of topic byond Deep Learning. Videos and slides available:

- [video lectures](http://videolectures.net/site/search/?q=MLSS)
- [2020 videos](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2020/schedule.html)
- I find myself flipping back and forth between this and [the Deep Dive Book](https://d2l.ai/)
