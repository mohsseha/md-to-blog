# Compensation For ML/DS:

Ah yes compensation, one of the hardest part of choosing and maintaining a job. Here are a few reference points (biased towards the Boston market): 

## FAANG:

hard to measure against depending on who you are hiring or where you are working but it implicitly affect the dynamics of your co-workers. 

Here are a few resources to get an estimate:

_Note_: 
- This data is *almost certainly* baised. It's tricky to figure out in which direction. 
- This is global, location makes a huge difference. 
- Even not particularly fancy big companies can pay more than you expect: https://www.levels.fyi/company/Walmart/salaries/


## Contracting: 
I've seen this vary widely depending on the experiance and the speciality of the person you are working with. Expect to pay $75/hour for someone who is trying a new skill set and have you pay for it, up to well north of $200/hour for ex-microsoft/google engineers doing freelance work. 

Even on a place like upwork.com you can find people charging >$400/hour for ML work (granted these are published specialists). 


## Entry positions: 

From personal experiance I've seen $140k/year is practical minimum for someone with a related PhD if you are doing ML maybe slightly less if doing DS.
