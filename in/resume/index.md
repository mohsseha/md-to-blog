## Recent Work History

### Manager, ML Modeling, iRobot — 2018 -
I was internally recruited to develop the marquee feature of next-gen robots. My team's focus is on: 

- **ML Research & Development** of robot embedded CNN models that:  
	- are optimized for detection, localization and embedding.
	- have <1% error in *millions* of homes globally.
- **Scalable Data collection processes and infrastructure** with: 
	- ~10^8 labeled and unlabeled images.
	- guaranteed user privacy exceeding GDPR requirements.
	- *cost effective* real image labeling and synthetic data generation.
- **Corporate ML technology support:** 
	- Supported iRobot Ventures in making investment decisions in 10's of companies globally.
	- IP/patent production (details below).

As the team leader I focus on: 

- *Product strategy* developing ML product roadmaps that meet PM, UX and cost constraints. 
- *Scientific leadership* help my team review and build on latest DL/ML literature.
- *Software architecture* selecting the right tools and vendors to support our data pipeline and training needs. 
- *Team growth* grew the teams from a couple of interns to a team of 25+ full timers. I Interviewed 100's of candidates and worked with HR to substantially improve amd enhance our diversity and inclusion process. 

### Principle Data Scientist, iRobot — 2017-2018
- Developed data science models that distilled the data streaming from millions of robots to actionable intelligence used everywhere from rank-and-file engineers to executives. 
- Led research to support cutting-edge digital robot user experiences focused on machine learning and augmented reality. Built The minimal viable products that were used to to prove out concepts and solidify product roadmaps.
- Hired, mentored, and sometimes managed teams to support the above three focus areas.

### Lead Instructor, General Assembly & Professional Speaker at No Fluff Just Stuff Conferences — 2015-
Taught DS/ML programs and professional conference workshops that vary in length from a single day to multiple months. Topics include ML methods, visualization, Big Data, software architecture, etc.

### Data Scientist & Software Architect, EnerNOC, — 2014-2016
- Researched different methods of modeling and projecting energy data and time-series (25 provisional & issued patents).
- Managed and participated in academic collaborations with WPI, MIT and Harvard in the areas of energy and machine learning software Architecture.
- I designed and built multiple IoT time-series processing engines to for  energy analytics products. These systems consumed  TBs/day in a near realtime using Apache Spark and AWS Lambda. 

### Automation Tech Lead/Sr. Software Engineer, Vecna, — 2011-2014
- Designed & wrote base testing service using standard tools (Selenium, AWS, Docker, Jenkins).
- Hired and trained a team of 4 engineers to introduce company-wade automation.
- I was the sole maintainer and dev ops engineer for the GoalMind product. GoalMind was a **250k** LOC internal Java/JavaScript web-app that managed finances, time-keeping and planning for Vecna and it's VA customers spanning 1000’s of hospitals that serve millions of patients.

## Tools
I have evaluated, used and taught many tools over the years, some of my favorites: 

- *Machine Learning & Data Science:* TensorFlow, CoreML, Apache Spark and Kubeflow Pipelines.
- *Languages:* Wolfram, Clojure/ClojureScript, Java, Python and Scala snd others. 
- *Cloud and distributed systems*: I've been using linux since 0.96, and used it to build big and small systems on anything from hand-built HPC clusters to large scale AWS and GCP deployments. Most recently, I have been using Kubeflow Pipelines to train and validate ML models at the scale of 10's of millions of images.

## Older Work Experience 
### Co-Founder and CTO, Syphir LLC; Boston, MA — 2008-2010
I assembled and led a team that won the 1st prize MIT Arab Business Plan Competition($50k), we used the prize to kickstart the company and release two products (*LabelRank* and *SmartPush*) that were used by thousands of paying customers. Elements of these products have been incorporated into Gmail 
### Associate Product Manager(Intern), Google Inc.; Mountain View, CA — Summer 2007
- Developed a internal product to understand and forecast global Google datacenter resource utilization 
- Did research on rational pricing of cluster resources for planet-scale applications
- My 20% time project was a novel UI element that was patented and is still used by Chrome today
### Research Assistant, MIT; Cambridge, MA — 2004-2010
*PhD Topic:* Variance Reduced Monte-Carlo Gas Simulations on Distributed Systems 
- I was responsible for the design, building and administration of my group’s High Performance Computing facilities, networks and software
- Led a team of 20 MIT faculty and graduate students on a visit to Saudi Aramco; the trek resulted in a multi-million dollar collaboration between Aramco and the MIT Energy Institute
### Consulting Engineer, Saudi Aramco, — 2003-2004, 2010-2012
