## Summary
I am a leader & solution maker focused in the area of AI/ML especially for vision based applications. I pride myself in mastering the trade-offs needed to build software and data-driven systems that deliver value, quickly, accurately and with minimal complexity. I excel at creating happy and effective teams that create delightful products.

- *KFUPM - Saudi Arabia*, BS 1998, Mechanical Engineering

## Recent Work History

### Director, Machine Learning, Symbotic - 2021 -
My focus has been on perception, mapping and data-strategy to support production ML/AI applications. Some highlights:
- Refocused the ML/Vision roadmap on a path that gives a positive ROI in months instead of years. Two key decisions: 1. Reformulating the robot perception problem to use new state-of-the-art Deep Learning networks and 2. adopting on-bot containerization to reduce development, manufacturing and distribution costs.
- The perception solutions are accurate to within a millimeter and can scale to an error rate < 1/million transactions.
- Lead a team of 14 ML Engineers, Scientist and techs with a 7 figure budget.

### Manager, ML Modeling, iRobot — 2018 - 2021
Recruited to develop the marquee feature of Roomba J7: the ability to see obstacles in millions of homes when cleaning with with error rate of <0.1%. The team:
- Grew from 1 to a peak of 10 with (~50% of team had PhDs).
- Employed state of the art data pipelines and technologies to create privacy preserving (GDPR), reproducible, and completely automated AI/ML vision learning models. Technologies used include KubeFlow Pipelines, Population Based Training, Active Learning as well as a number of Semi-supervised pre-training and synthetic data methods. 

### Principle Data Scientist, iRobot — 2017-2018
- Developed data science models that distilled the data streaming from millions of robots to actionable intelligence used by everyone in the company (from executives down to rank-and-file engineers). 
- Research to support cutting-edge digital robot user experiences focused on machine learning and augmented reality. 
- Hire, mentor, collaborate with and managed teams to support the above three focus areas.

### Lead Instructor, General Assembly & Professional Speaker at No Fluff Just Stuff Conferences — 2015-
Taught DS/ML programs and professional conference workshops that vary in length from a single day to multiple months. Topics include machine learning methods, visualization, Big Data, software architecture & other related approaches.

### Data Scientist & Software Architect, EnerNOC, — 2014-2016
- Researched different methods of modeling and projecting energy data and time-series (25 provisional & issued patents).
- Managed and participated in academic collaborations with WPI, MIT and Harvard in the areas of energy and machine learning software Architecture.
- I designed and built multiple IoT time-series processing engines to for  energy analytics products. These systems consumed  TBs/day in a near realtime using Apache Spark and AWS Lambda. 

### Automation Tech Lead/Sr. Software Engineer, Vecna, — 2011-2014
- Designed & wrote base testing service using standard tools (Selenium, AWS, Docker, Jenkins).
- Hired and trained a team of 4 engineers to introduce company-wade automation.
- I was the sole maintainer and dev ops engineer for the GoalMind product. GoalMind was a **250k** LOC internal Java/JavaScript web-app that managed finances, time-keeping and planning for Vecna and it's VA customers spanning 1000’s of hospitals that serve millions of patients.

## Tools
I have evaluated, used and taught many tools over the years, some of my favorites: 

- *Machine Learning & Data Science:* TensorFlow, CoreML, Apache Spark and Kubeflow Pipelines.
- *Languages:* Clojure/ClojureScript, Python, Java, Wolfram, and Scala (in that order) 
- *Cloud and distributed systems*: I've been using linux since 0.96, and used it to build big and small systems on anything from hand-built HPC clusters to large scale AWS and GCP deployments.

## Older Work Experience 
### Co-Founder and CTO, Syphir LLC; Boston, MA — 2008-2010
I assembled and led a team that won the 1st prize MIT Arab Business Plan Competition($50k), we used the prize to kickstart the company and release two products (*LabelRank* and *SmartPush*) that were used by thousands of paying customers. Elements of these products have been incorporated into Gmail 
### Associate Product Manager(Intern), Google Inc.; Mountain View, CA — Summer 2007
- Developed a internal product to understand and forecast global Google datacenter resource utilization 
- Did research on rational pricing of cluster resources for planet-scale applications
- My 20% time project was a novel UI element that was patented and is still used by Chrome today
### Research Assistant, MIT; Cambridge, MA — 2004-2010
*PhD Topic:* Variance Reduced Monte-Carlo Gas Simulations on Distributed Systems 
- I was responsible for the design, building and administration of my group’s High Performance Computing facilities, networks and software
- Led a team of 20 MIT faculty and graduate students on a visit to Saudi Aramco; the trek resulted in a multi-million dollar collaboration between Aramco and the MIT Energy Institute
### Consulting Engineer, Saudi Aramco, — 2003-2004, 2010-2012
One of two engineers representing the final technical authority for the selection, maintenance and operation of the 380+ gas turbines that pump the majority of Saudi Arabia’s oil
